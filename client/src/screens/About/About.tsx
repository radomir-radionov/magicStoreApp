        What draws nearly half of all older Americans — and an even larger
        percentage of those younger than us — to play so many games on a phone,
        computer or console hooked up to a TV?

        The easy answer is that it is a temporary escape from the pressures of
        the real world — an essential distraction, particularly over this past
        year. And yes, lots of online games qualify as wonderful diversions:
        Countless Americans pass some time each day playing sudoku, Candy Crush,
        Angry Birds and other puzzle games on their phones or tablets.

        But that is just one segment of the gaming market. Step beyond the
        fast-gratification phone games, and you emerge into a world where the
        player is more than ever an active participant in a game is narrative.
        Your decisions and actions impact where the story goes, as opposed to
        watching a film or TV, during which you are a passive couch potato.

        A good game lets you not only depart your reality but also create a new
        one. You are not restricted by your age, height, gender or physical
        disabilities.

        To understand gaming, forget the technology and focus on the humanity.
        It is in our nature to join the fray, to learn the rules and master the
        system, to build things (and for some of us, to blow them up), to gain
        and lose, to chill out and chalk up -— and even brag about our scores —
        to spin entire worlds from only our imaginations.

        No surprise that the tensions of the pandemic brought more people into
        the gaming fold. A survey by Deloitte, a professional services company,
        found that 34 percent of those surveyed had tried a new video gaming
        activity in 2020. Those activities range from playing a new game to
        subscribing to a game service to watching someone else play in the
        growing phenomenon called e-sports. And industry analysts say a lot of
        those people are likely to remain engaged.
